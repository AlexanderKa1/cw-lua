# Eventually-Consistent Data Structures

This is a partial Lua implementation of the [Eventually-Consistent Data Structures
described by Sean Cribbs](http://www.slideshare.net/seancribbs/eventuallyconsistent-data-structures)
and inspired by [the work of Marc Shapiro et al. at INRIA](http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/55/55/88/PDF/techreport.pdf).

More comprehensive implementations exist:

- [in Ruby](https://github.com/aphyr/meangirls);
- [in Erlang](https://github.com/mochi/statebox/);
- [in Clojure](https://github.com/reiddraper/knockbox).
