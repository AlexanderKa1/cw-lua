# Catwell's Lua playground

This repository is used to store the various Open Source tools,
algorithms and libraries I write in Lua (or rather LuaJIT + FFI)
that do not deserve their own repository.

## Contains:

- sha256: A SHA-256 implementation in pure LuaJIT+FFI.
- lua-pipe: syntax experiment, Lua version of Pipe in Python.
